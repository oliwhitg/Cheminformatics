# Cheminformatics

Project code to analyse solubility data

The code is split into the chapters of the writeup using jupyter notebook

Data files are included, including both processed and unprocessed test data

Directory links will need to be changed @Data_source

A variety of plots are generated and titled which are not included in the writeup to save space

Advanced statistics lines are commented out, but will produce a full OLS analysis
